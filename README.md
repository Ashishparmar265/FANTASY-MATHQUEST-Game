# FANTASY-MATHQUEST-Game
THE IDEAL GAMER FOR MY GAME ARE CHILDREN AROUND THE AGE 5-10, WHO ARE TRY TO LEARN BASIC MATHEMATIC. THE INSPIRATION BEHIND THE GAME IS MY LITTLE SISTER WHO DOESN’T LIKE MATHEMATIC AND LOVE MOBILE GAMES, SO I THOUGHT OF DEVELOPING A FANTASY GAME THAT TRY TO TEACH HER MATH ALONG WITH ENTERTAINING HER. THE GAME WILL TRY TO TEACH ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION AT LEVEL 1, MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION AT LEVEL 2, ADDITION SUBTRACTION MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION AT LEVEL 3, AND BOADMAS AT LEVEL 4.
